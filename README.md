# WeatherForecastApp
WeatherForecastApp is a SwiftUI application built using The Composable Architecture that provides weather forecasts based on a city name input. The API also recognizes partial city names, so typing "Lond" will still return the forecast for London.
## Features
* Search for weather by city name
* Partial name recognition for convenience
* Displays temperature, weather conditions, and other relevant data
* Built entirely in SwiftUI using TCA for a scalable, modular architecture
